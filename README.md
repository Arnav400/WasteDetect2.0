# Waste Detection Application

**Waste Detection Application** is a Python-based project designed to identify and classify waste materials using machine learning. The application leverages image processing techniques and a pre-trained model to detect and categorize various types of waste.

## Features

- **Waste Classification:** Identifies and classifies different types of waste from images.
- **Real-Time Detection:** Provides real-time waste detection and classification.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Easy-to-use interface for uploading images and viewing results.
- **Model Training:** Includes functionality to train the model with new data if needed.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** TensorFlow/Keras, OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib
- **Data:** Pre-trained model or custom dataset for training
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook (for development), Flask (for web interface, if applicable)
